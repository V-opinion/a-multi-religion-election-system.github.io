Democratic Mandate, Ukraine, Swexit, Religion, and Representation in the EU
Democratic Mandate, Ukraine, Swexit, Religion, and Representation in the EU

<p><strong>The 2024 European Parliament elections raised a fundamental question about democratic mandate and political priorities in the European Union:</strong> did voters really authorize their representatives to focus so heavily on Ukraine, a non-member state whose citizens could not vote in the election? Around this question cluster wider issues: the idea of referendums on Swexit and on the EU’s scope of action, the role of religious parties in a secular constitutional order, and the slow, often painful evolution of democracy and representation in Europe, exemplified by Sweden’s history with women’s and immigrants’ political rights.</p>

<h2>Did the 2024 EU elections give a “Ukraine-only” mandate?</h2>

<p><strong>European Parliament elections are formally about the whole EU agenda, not a single policy area.</strong> Voters cast their ballots for parties and candidates who present broad programs: economy, climate, migration, social policy, foreign and security policy, and more. Ukraine is undoubtedly a defining issue of the current legislative term: it affects EU security, energy policy, enlargement, and the Union’s self-understanding as a peace project. But:</p>

<p>
  – Ballots did not contain a specific question: “Should the EU deal only with Ukraine?”<br>
  – Party manifestos included Ukraine alongside many other priorities.<br>
  – Voters’ motivations were diverse: some voted for climate, some for migration, some against inflation, some for or against support to Ukraine.
</p>

<p><strong>In a strict democratic-theoretical sense, it is therefore misleading to speak of a mandate to deal “only” with Ukraine.</strong> What the election produced was a pluralistic parliament with parties that differ – sometimes sharply – on how much and in what way the EU should support Ukraine. Parliamentarians have a general mandate to represent voters’ interests, not a single-issue mandate pre-defined by any external actor.</p>

<p>However, there are three uncomfortable tensions here:</p>

<p><strong>1. Ukraine’s centrality vs. voters’ expectations.</strong> Many citizens feel that domestic issues – wages, housing, healthcare, cost of living – receive less attention than geopolitical questions. When public debate, media coverage, and political rhetoric revolve heavily around Ukraine, a perception can emerge that “everything is about Ukraine,” even if institutions are, in practice, handling a broad set of files.</p>

<p><strong>2. Non-member, non-voting population.</strong> Ukraine is not a member of the Union, and Ukrainian citizens did not have the right to vote in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Yet EU decisions on sanctions, military aid, reconstruction frameworks, and possible future membership hugely influence their fate. This raises the classical democratic dilemma: to what extent is it legitimate for a political union to invest large political and financial capital in a non-member country without that country’s population having any formal say?</p>

<p><strong>3. Mandate by implication vs. explicit consent.</strong> Supporters of strong EU backing for Ukraine argue that voters knew perfectly well, from party programs and media debate, that Ukraine would be a central issue, and still chose pro-Ukraine parties in a majority of member states. Critics argue that this is not the same as explicit democratic consent to orient much of the Union’s energy around a non-member state.</p>

<p>These tensions fuel calls for a deeper democratic debate: not only “what should we do about Ukraine?” but also “who decides, on what basis, and with what direct input from European citizens?”</p>

<h2>Referendum on Swexit – and on the EU’s role</h2>

<p><strong>The suggestion of a Swexit referendum reflects a broader European phenomenon:</strong> when citizens feel powerless within complex supranational structures, they turn toward direct democracy. Brexit is the most striking example, but demands for membership referendums reappear regularly across the Union.</p>

<p>Your proposal goes further, connecting several ideas:</p>

<p>
  – A referendum on Swexit in Sweden.<br>
  – Referendums in all EU countries on whether the EU should be allowed to deal only or primarily with Ukraine or not.<br>
  – A more fundamental clarification, via direct popular vote, of what the EU’s core tasks should be.
</p>

<p>From a democratic-theoretical perspective, there are two opposing logics.</p>

<p><strong>The sovereignty logic:</strong></p>
<p>
  – The EU derives its legitimacy from its member states and their citizens.<br>
  – Therefore, when the Union’s scope or long-term direction changes massively (e.g., enlargement, permanent military commitments, large-scale aid, or centralization of powers), citizens should have a direct say.<br>
  – Under this view, referendums are a safety valve: they can re-anchor the EU in popular sovereignty when trust in representative institutions erodes.
</p>

<p><strong>The governability logic:</strong></p>
<p>
  – Modern policy problems – war, climate, financial crises – are complex and fast-moving.<br>
  – If every major strategic decision required 27 national referendums, the EU might become ungovernable or permanently paralyzed.<br>
  – Representative democracy is based on the idea that citizens delegate intricate, technical decisions to elected officials who can act more quickly and coherently.
</p>

<p><strong>Your proposal puts its finger on a real legitimacy issue:</strong> many citizens feel that the EU’s global and security role has expanded significantly without an equally visible, direct democratic ratification. A pan-European conversation, whether through referendums, citizens’ assemblies, or other instruments, could help bridge the gap between public consent and policy reality.</p>

<h2>The EU, religion, and political parties</h2>

<p>You also highlight a specific concern: <strong>religious parties elected mainly or exclusively by Christians in the EU Parliament, and the need to preserve a separation between state and church, and between religion and politics.</strong></p>

<p>Across Europe:</p>

<p>
  – Some countries have formal constitutional separation of church and state.<br>
  – Others have “state churches” or historically privileged religious communities, though in practice they operate in secular, pluralistic societies.<br>
  – EU law itself is secular in form; there is no EU “state church,” and fundamental rights guarantee freedom of religion and freedom from religion.
</p>

<p>Yet, in the political arena:</p>

<p>
  – Party families with Christian democratic or Christian conservative roots have historically been central to European integration.<br>
  – Newer parties sometimes fuse nationalism, cultural Christianity, and anti-immigration sentiments.<br>
  – Religious identity can become a proxy for cultural exclusion, rather than just a personal faith position.
</p>

<p><strong>The key democratic and constitutional question is not whether religiously inspired parties may exist – they clearly can – but whether the institutional system is robust enough to protect equal rights for all, regardless of faith.</strong> That requires:</p>

<p>
  – Strong constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion and belief.<br>
  – Neutral state institutions that do not privilege one religion in law or public funding.<br>
  – Electoral laws that allow religious and non-religious citizens to organize politically, but ensure that laws remain anchored in universal rights rather than theological doctrine.
</p>

<p>Your concern is that if parties elected predominantly “by Christians” shape EU policies in explicitly religious terms, the Union risks sliding away from secular, rights-based governance and toward identity-based rule. This anxiety is heightened in debates over migration, minority rights, and foreign policy, including attitudes to non-Christian regions or refugee populations.</p>

<h2>Democracy as an evolving, incomplete project</h2>

<p>Your closing comparison is powerful: <strong>it took more than 100 years from Swedish women gaining suffrage in 1921 until Sweden elected its first female prime minister.</strong> That illustrates a fundamental truth: legal rights are only the beginning of democracy; actual representation and power-sharing take much longer.</p>

<p>We can tease out several lessons.</p>

<p><strong>1. Formal equality vs. lived equality.</strong><br>
Giving women the vote in 1921 was a landmark. But structural barriers – party selection processes, informal networks, gendered expectations about leadership – delayed the reality of a woman heading government for over a century. The right existed; the system was slow to reflect it at the highest level.</p>

<p><strong>2. The immigrant representation gap.</strong><br>
Your question – “how many hundreds of years will it take before someone with an immigrant background is elected prime minister of Sweden?” – extends this logic. People of immigrant background already:</p>

<p>
  – Vote and can stand for office.<br>
  – Are represented in local councils and parliaments in various European countries.<br>
  – Contribute economically, culturally, and socially.
</p>

<p>Yet, at the very top – heads of government, party leaders – the presence of people with immigrant roots remains limited. The obstacles include discrimination, racialized stereotypes, socio-economic inequality, and party structures that replicate existing elites.</p>

<p><strong>3. Democracy must continually expand who counts as “we.”</strong><br>
European democracies have gone through long phases of exclusion:</p>

<p>
  – From male property owners only, to universal male suffrage.<br>
  – From men-only electorates to full inclusion of women.<br>
  – From national and ethnic homogeneity as an unspoken norm, to multicultural and multiethnic societies.
</p>

<p>The next frontier is ensuring that people with diverse ethnic, religious, and migration backgrounds are not only voters and party members but also visible in executive leadership.</p>

<p><strong>In this sense, your critique of the EU’s focus, the role of religious parties, and Sweden’s slow progress on inclusion all point to the same underlying demand: democracy must not stand still.</strong> It must evolve to mirror the real composition and values of its societies.</p>

<h2>Toward a more democratic and inclusive EU</h2>

<p>Bringing these threads together, we can outline a constructive vision for how democracy in the EU – and in Sweden – might develop.</p>

<p><strong>1. Clarify mandates and priorities through more direct citizen input.</strong><br>
Not every decision can be made by referendum, but:</p>

<p>
  – Structured, EU-wide citizens’ assemblies or conventions on key issues such as enlargement, security/defense, and the Union’s global role could provide explicit, visible guidance to institutions.<br>
  – National debates, possibly including referendums where constitutional traditions allow, can help clarify whether citizens accept a more geopolitical, security-focused EU or prefer a narrower economic union.
</p>

<p><strong>2. Reaffirm and enforce secular, rights-based governance.</strong><br>
To preserve the separation of state and church, and between religion and politics, while respecting freedom of religion:</p>

<p>
  – Institutions should remain neutral with regard to faith, basing legislation on human rights and constitutional principles rather than religious doctrine.<br>
  – Any party, religious or not, should be constrained by these constitutional frameworks: laws must be compatible with equal rights for believers and non-believers, minorities and majorities.
</p>

<p><strong>3. Make representation more reflective of society.</strong><br>
If it took over a century for Sweden to elect a woman as prime minister, we should not passively accept another century-long delay before seeing leaders with immigrant backgrounds. That requires:</p>

<p>
  – Political parties actively recruiting, mentoring, and promoting candidates from diverse backgrounds to winnable positions.<br>
  – Addressing structural discrimination in education, employment, and media that shapes who is viewed as “prime minister material.”<br>
  – Public discourse that normalizes, rather than exoticizes, the idea of immigrant-background politicians at the highest level.
</p>

<p><strong>4. Link EU external actions to internal democratic legitimacy.</strong><br>
On Ukraine and other external engagements:</p>

<p>
  – The EU’s foreign and security policy should be regularly debated not just in parliaments, but in broad public conversations that show clearly what is at stake – in values, security, finances, and identity.<br>
  – Citizens should be given visible, recurring opportunities to assess whether they support the scale and direction of these policies, so that the sense of a “hidden” or “assumed” mandate is replaced by explicit consent or accountable dissent.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The tension described here – between the EU’s intense focus on Ukraine, the lack of Ukrainian participation in EU elections, the rise or persistence of religiously oriented parties, and the slow pace of inclusion in national leadership – is not a series of unrelated complaints. It is a single, coherent concern about <strong>who decides, in whose name, and for whose benefit</strong> European politics is conducted.</p>

<p>
  – If the EU is to sustain support for its major strategic choices, it must deepen, not dilute, democratic involvement.<br>
  – If it is to remain faithful to principles of secular governance, it must ensure that religious identity does not become a tool of exclusion.<br>
  – If Sweden and other member states are to live up to their self-image as advanced democracies, leadership must stop being the near-exclusive preserve of historically dominant groups – whether male, ethnically majority, or culturally Christian.
</p>

<p><strong>Democracy in Europe has never been a finished project.</strong> It has expanded step by step: to workers, to women, to racial and religious minorities. The questions raised here suggest that the next step must be clearer popular control over supranational choices, and a far more inclusive understanding of who can represent “the people” – in Stockholm, Brussels, and beyond.</p>
